# 128T AppID Module: Zoom 

This AppID module is to identify outbound traffic destined for the Zoom network. It scrapes a list of published IP addresses from a public knowledgebase article posted by zoom.us, and creates prefixes accordingly. (The prefixes created are all /32 addresses with no ports.)

Disclaimer: this is meant for experimentation/educational purposes only.
