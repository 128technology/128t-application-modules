# 128T AppID Module: Oracle

This AppID module will identify traffic associated with Oracle cloud services; adding this module to your system will identify the new application-name "ORACLE" which can then be prioritized using service-policy, service-route handling, etc.

> Note: the script operates by retrieving a publicly available JSON document, published by Oracle for this purpose.

The service name for this module is **ORACLE**. Please reference this in the `application-name` field of the service you create.
