# 128T AppID Module: Facebook

This AppID module will identify traffic associated with Facebook; adding this module to your system will identify the new application-name "FACEBOOK" which can then be prioritized using service-policy, service-route handling, etc.

> Note: the script operates by retrieving IPv4 prefixes from `https://netify.ai`, therefore the system must have internet access to retrieve the document.

The service name for this module is FACEBOOK. Please reference this in the `application-name` field of the service you create.

Disclaimer: this is a community contributed module.
